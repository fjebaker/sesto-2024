# Sesto 2024

This repository contains the presentation source, slides, and code for my talk at the _Sledging down the potential well_ conference in Sesto, July 2024.

## Abstract:

> Title: Advancements in the theory and practice of spectral variability
> modelling
>
> Existing spectral and variability models for AGN have predominantly focused
> on a lamp post corona over an optically thick but geometrically thin
> accretion disc in the equatorial plane. These models have been useful in
> understanding many features of observations, but their limitations are
> becoming restrictive, and in some cases are experimentally excluded or even
> theoretically incompatible. I will discuss our recent work in developing a
> suite of new spectral models, showcasing results from varying the morphology
> of the corona and the particular model of the disc, and how these alter our
> spectral predictions. Our models can compute these results with any static,
> axis-symmetric metric, inviting new and sophisticated opportunities for tests
> of relativity. I will also discuss details of the underlying theoretical and
> algorithmic advancements that have made these results possible and ready to
> fit to observation.
